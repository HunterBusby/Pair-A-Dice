      { "key": "Tut_7", "value": "Go right ahead, dear guest." },

      { "key": "Tut_8", "value": "No need to wait." },

      { "key": "Tut_9", "value": "Perhaps it has simply been so long since you've handled fresh dice that you've forgotten?" },
      { "key": "Tut_10", "value": "Worry not, dear guest, no need to be embarrassed." },
      { "key": "Tut_11", "value": "The Re-Roll Parlor is proud to serve guests who are new, returning, or just a bit... rusty." },
      { "key": "Tut_12", "value": "I’ll walk you through each step as if you’ve never played before. Just follow my lead!" },
      { "key": "Tut_13", "value": "The first step to any Pair-A-Dice game is the dice." },
      { "key": "Tut_14", "value": "Each player will keep their dice in the designated 'Dice Zone'. In this case, to your right." },
      { "key": "Tut_15", "value": "Next, you must 'connect' with your dice." },
      { "key": "Tut_16", "value": "To connect, simply move yourself over the Dice Zone." },
      { "key": "Tut_17", "value": "The dice should glow once the connection is established." },
      { "key": "Tut_18", "value": "While connected, click and drag to create a shaking motion. Do not release until they go." },

      { "key": "Tut_22", "value": "Well done, valued contestant! That was some excellent form!" },
      { "key": "Tut_23", "value": "You and those dice may just become fast friends." },
      { "key": "Tut_24", "value": "Since this is a fresh pair of dice, it takes a little more shaking to get them to go." },
      { "key": "Tut_25", "value": "The more you connect with your dice, the more responsive they'll become." },
      { "key": "Tut_26", "value": "Next, let’s turn our attention to the cards." },
      { "key": "Tut_27", "value": "Each match begins with both players holding an equal number of cards." },
      { "key": "Tut_28", "value": "Your cards are placed on the side closest to you. Your opponent's cards sit politely on theirs." },
      { "key": "Tut_29", "value": "The game is won by the first to rid themselves of all cards on their side of the table." },
      { "key": "Tut_30", "value": "Now, let’s discuss the most thrilling part: matching cards!" },
      { "key": "Tut_31", "value": "When you roll the dice, they combine into a single total." },
      { "key": "Tut_32", "value": "That total is your key. Your golden number, if you will." },
      { "key": "Tut_33", "value": "If a card’s number matches your dice total, you may click it to send it to your opponent." },
      { "key": "Tut_34", "value": "For example: roll a 3 and a 4, and you may send away a card with the number 7." },
      { "key": "Tut_35", "value": "Each card you offload brings you one step closer to winning." },
      { "key": "Tut_36", "value": "But beware! Your opponent can do the same to you!" },
      { "key": "Tut_37", "value": "There is no need to wait or take turns, for surely your opponent will not." },
      { "key": "Tut_38", "value": "Once the game begins, dice will roll and cards will be exchanged until a victor is decided." },
      { "key": "Tut_39", "value": "Remember, the first to clear their side of the table wins!" },
      { "key": "Tut_40", "value": "Why don't you give it a try now? Roll the dice and see what matches await." },

      { "key": "Tut_43", "value": "Excellent! A firm grasp of the rules and a gentle touch on the dice. Promising indeed." },
      { "key": "Tut_44", "value": "Now, before we send you into your first official match, there’s just one more detail to cover." },
      { "key": "Tut_45", "value": "Some opponents, particularly high-ranking ones, may use 'special abilities'." },
      { "key": "Tut_46", "value": "Individuals can gain a 'special ability' at any point in their game career." },
      { "key": "Tut_47", "value": "These abilities allow a player to bend the rules slightly, affecting the cards, altering rolls, even affecting the board layout." },
      { "key": "Tut_48", "value": "It’s all part of the Re-Roll Parlor's commitment to dynamic, unpredictable entertainment!" },
      { "key": "Tut_49", "value": "Now, as a new contestant, your account has not yet been assigned any registered abilities." },
      { "key": "Tut_50", "value": "Should that ever change... we will, of course, be very surprised and happy for you." },
      { "key": "Tut_51", "value": "For now, your only objective is to roll, match, and outpace your opponent." },
      { "key": "Tut_52", "value": "Good luck, dear guest. And remember: even losing is a form of progress. (For one of us, anyway.)" },

      { "key": "EchoReveal_2", "value": "—Apologies! Please continue playing as if nothing happened." },

      { "key": "EchoReveal_3", "value": "Oh! It seems you've gained a... 'Special Ability' of your own." },
      { "key": "EchoReveal_4", "value": "A 'Power-Up' type, by the looks of it. How unexpected!" },
      { "key": "EchoReveal_5", "value": "Power-Up abilities require certain conditions on the field to activate." },
      { "key": "EchoReveal_6", "value": "Once those conditions are met, you’ll be able to trigger your ability. Manually or automatically, depending on its design." },
      { "key": "EchoReveal_7", "value": "In your case. It appears to be connected to what you rolled." },
      { "key": "EchoReveal_8", "value": "Please continue rolling. For documentation purposes, of course." },
      { "key": "EchoReveal_9", "value": "...Fascinating. No prior record of this effect exists in our archives." },
